Hi! I'm Subhajit, and I'm a graduate student at Boston University, studying CS + ML. Previously, I worked at a start-up, called Fyle, as one of its early engineer team members. I optimized their legacy API latency and built many software features from scrach.

Currently, I'm learning about NLP and LLMs.

I love building tools to solve problems. I building developer tools with the powere of LLM APIs like GPT-3. You can find some of them on my [github](https://github.com/0verread)
