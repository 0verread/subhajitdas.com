when i was in 8th grade, i failed in my math test. my math professor came to me and told me that i won't be a good engineer if i'm not good at math. i was heartbroken because i really wanted to become an engineer and be good at it, but i wasn't sure how to imporve my math grade, let alone be good at it. so i asked that math professor how to be good at math and he said that to be good at anything, you have to love it. so i forced myself to love it, day and night, whenver i can, and after 3 months it loved me back. i got 94% in my math test, topped the class.

now you might be thinking why i'm suddenly writing this blog. that's because a few days back i commneted on a linkedin post stating that there has been a mojor downgrade in skills of software engineers because a lot of people came to this industry for money, and they won't learn and write code if they're not getting paid. this commnet of mine actually offended some people, most of them didn't understand what i meant. so i thought of writing a small post about why you need to love something to be great at it.
