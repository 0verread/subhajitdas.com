they say "you're the average of the five people you hangout", i would say "you're the sum of the work you do in your free time". what you do outside your nine-to-five work tells a lot about you. you might like going to a bar and have a drink or two with you close buddy, or you maybe like going home and chill on your couch waching game - those are the great way to spend your time free time to relax yourself, and why wouldn't you. afterall you worked really hard at your work. and most improtantly, that's how cool people spend their time. you're definitely not like that guy in the office who sits right next to you. he goes home, does some boring things like cooking, and work on his side projects 3-4 hours before he goes to bed. what a nerd. so what if everyone in the office thinks he's smarter than you, at least you're cool. so what if he gets higher salary bump next year, at least you've a life.


if working little extra to be great at my work, earn little extra money indicates that i have a boring life or no life at all, i would choose that life every single day. not because i don't like having fun time, it's because i really like being good at my work. you can't expect to be good at your work if it's just your nine-to-five life. it has to be a part of your life.
