Hi, hello there! I am Subhajit (my friends call me *Jeet*). Currently, I am a student at Boston University, studying Computer Science.

I've worked at [OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/) and [Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com/) in the past as a software engineer.

When I'm not studying, I'm working on my projects, and when I'm not working on my projects, I am either working out at the gym or hanging out with my friends.
