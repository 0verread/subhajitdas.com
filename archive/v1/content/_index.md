Hi, hello there! I am Subhajit ( my friends call me *Jeet* ). Currently, I am a student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), studying Computer Science.

I've worked at [OpenText](https://www.opentext.com/) and a start-up called [Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com/) in the past as a software engineer.

I've been playing with computers since I was 8 years old and coding since I was 15. My first crush was Filming but never persued it (yes, I wanted to be a director ), Physics was ( still is) my best friend growing up, but later I realized that the love of my life, Computers, were always there with me from the start. I fell in love with it in high school and ended up marrying to it.
